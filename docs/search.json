In 2019, I moved to Estonia and started working in an international fintech company as an Anti-Money Laundering and Backoffice specialist.\nIn 2023, my passion for global business operations drove me to apply for the IBA Master program at Viadrina. I am currently in my second semester and studying a cross-functional program with a focus on the Management & Marketing and Data Science & Decision Support tracks. My professional aim is to secure a position in a dynamic multinational corporation where I can apply my expertise in data-driven decision-making and strategic marketing to drive business growth and innovation.
