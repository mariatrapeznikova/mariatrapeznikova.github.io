Hello! My name is Maria Trapeznikova and I am pursuing a Master's degree in International Business Administration (IBA) at [Viadrina University](https://www.europa-uni.de/en/index.html).

In 2010, I graduated from [Ural Federal University](https://urfu.ru/en/) with a Corporate Management Diploma and a Project Management specialization. After that, I gained eight years of experience working as a Project Manager in the real estate development and construction sphere. You can find more information about the projects I was envolved in on the [Projects](projects.qmd) page. In 2019, I moved to Estonia and started working in an international fintech company as an Anti-Money Laundering and Backoffice specialist.

In 2023, my passion for global business operations drove me to apply for the IBA Master program at Viadrina. I am currently in my second semester and studying a cross-functional program with a focus on the Management & Marketing and Data Science & Decision Support tracks. My professional aim is to secure a position in a dynamic multinational corporation where I can apply my expertise in data-driven decision-making and strategic marketing to drive business growth and innovation. In the long term, I am also interested in pursuing a career in academia, where I can contribute to research and teach future business leaders.

My contact information you can find on the [Contact](contact.qmd) page.
